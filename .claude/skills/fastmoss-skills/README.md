## About FastMoss MCP

[FastMoss MCP](https://developers.fastmoss.com/mcp/overview.html) exposes FastMoss data and knowledge-base capabilities through the Model Context Protocol, so AI agents can query TikTok ecommerce data directly inside their working environment. Agents can call MCP tools to search objects, resolve IDs, pull rankings, inspect product/shop/creator/video/livestream details, analyze trends, and build FastMoss-site detail links.

FastMoss MCP is designed for quick integration with mainstream MCP-compatible AI clients and agent tools, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, Cherry Studio, Trae, and other clients that support MCP server configuration. After connecting the MCP server, users can ask natural-language questions like "find growth-stage products in the US beauty category", "which creators are selling this product", or "why did this shop's sales drop" and let the agent call FastMoss tools behind the scenes.

To try it, open the [FastMoss MCP overview](https://developers.fastmoss.com/mcp/overview.html) and follow the integration guide. New users can start with a 3-day free trial.

## About This Skill

## Install With npx

Install this skill into any AI client that supports local skill folders:

### Prerequisites

Before running the `npx` command, make sure you have:

- Node.js LTS installed. Node.js includes `npm` and `npx`; Node.js 18 or later is recommended.
- Network access to the npm registry, because `npx` downloads `@fastmoss/fastmoss-skills` on demand.
- An AI client that supports local skill folders.
- A target skills directory. New users can use the `--client claude` quick command below; other clients can pass `--dest`.
- FastMoss MCP installed and connected if you want live TikTok Shop data analysis. The skill can be installed without MCP, but live data tools require MCP.

Check your local environment:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
npx --version
```

If these commands are missing, install Node.js LTS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) first. You do not need to install this package globally.

### Quick Commands

For Claude-compatible local skill folders:

```bash
npx -y @fastmoss/fastmoss-skills install --client claude
```

To see built-in examples and options:

```bash
npx -y @fastmoss/fastmoss-skills install --help
```

### Custom Skills Directory

For other AI clients, pass the skills directory explicitly:

```bash
npx -y @fastmoss/fastmoss-skills install --dest "$HOME/.your-ai-client/skills"
```

You can also set the destination once through an environment variable:

```bash
AI_SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/your/ai-client/skills \
  npx -y @fastmoss/fastmoss-skills install
```

To replace an existing installation:

```bash
npx -y @fastmoss/fastmoss-skills install --client claude --force
```

Restart or reload your AI client after installation so the skill is discovered. FastMoss MCP must also be installed and connected for live TikTok Shop data analysis.

### Alternative: Install From GitHub

If you prefer not to use npm, clone the repository and move or symlink it into your AI client's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FastMoss/fastmoss-skills.git
mkdir -p "$AI_SKILLS_DIR"
ln -s "$(pwd)/fastmoss-skills" "$AI_SKILLS_DIR/fastmoss-skills"
```

If your client provides a GitHub skill installer, install the repository root as the skill:

```bash
repo: FastMoss/fastmoss-skills
path: .
name: fastmoss-skills
```
